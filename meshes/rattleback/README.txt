# Summary

Rattlebacks can only freely spin in one direction and were used by celtic priests for decision making or manipulation.

This is an easy to print, symmetrical rattleback with super secret technology inside to achieve the desired spinning direction.
Prints without support, needs 100% infill.
The downside has to be smooth for the rattleback to work correcty, simply use some sandpaper.
Spinning direction is indicated with right (clockwise) and left.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerGear
Printer: M2
Rafts: No

Notes: 
The Infill has to be 100% for the rattleback to work really well.
Resolution is unimportant since you have to use sandpaper anyway.
